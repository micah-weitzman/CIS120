## Homework Instructions

Please follow the instructions available here:

*   [Homework Description](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/hw/hw07)

## Running your code and tests

Note that the Codio menu now provides two modes of running your project:

*   Running the Java application in your browser

*   First “Compile” to update the code generated by your program.

*   Then use the “Run Chat Server” menu. This will start your server.

*   Then use the “Run Chat Client” menu. This will start your client. You can (and should) create several instances of the client to test your server.

*   To view the running application, in the menu bar to the right of the previous item, select PennPals. Assuming that the server/clients are running, it will show the running application in a new window or tab.

*   To run the JUnit Tests, click the Tools -> JUnit (Beta) in the menu bar. This will create a new tab in Codio called “JUnit (Beta)“. In this tab, you can view the results of your tests under “JUnit Executions”. There is also an option there to “Reexecute your tests”.

## Zipping and Submitting

Once you are finished, use the “Zip” menu item to create a file called “submit-hw07(-time).zip” and upload it here:
