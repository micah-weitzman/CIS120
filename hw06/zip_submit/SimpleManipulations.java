/*
 * The purpose of this assignment is to (re-) acquaint you with Java.
 *
 * You should fill in the body of the functions of this class. We have provided
 * a framework which will use these functions to manipulate images. As always,
 * you can add helper functions if you want. However, now that we're working in
 * Java, it is a good idea to make helper functions "private" (sort of like not
 * including functions in the MLI file in OCaml).
 *
 * You will need to look at the provided PixelPicture.java and Pixel.java files
 * to see if there are any helpful functions in them. However, you should not
 * modify these files, and you don't need to understand the code in each
 * function - you just need to understand how to use any functions you need.
 * Similarly, you will need to use two provided classes, ColorMap and IntQueue,
 * in order to complete the reducePalette() and flood() functions, respectively.
 * Instructions for using those classes are included with the instructions for
 * each problem.
 *
 * In each problem, don't modify the original picture. You should create a copy
 * of the picture passed to each function, modify it, and return it.
 *
 * Hint: think of a picture as a 2-dimensional array of Pixels. This
 * representation of images is called a Bitmap.

     * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignetting
     *
     * We'll do this by calculating the distance from each pixel to the
     * center of the image, and then multiplying the color values of that
     * pixel by one minus the square of that distance. In other words,
     *
     * 1. Find the x,y coordinates of the center pixels of the image,
     *    cx and cy. For example, if the image has width 5 and height 3,
     *    then the center pixel is located at (2,1). We'll use doubles
     *    to represent this value, in order to account for cases where
     *    the picture has an even number of pixels. For example, if the
     *    width is 4 and the height 6, then the center is at (1.5, 2.5).
     *
     * 2. For each pixel in the image, find its (proportional) distance
     *    d from the center.  This is the distance from the center in the
     *    x and y directions, divided by the total distance from the center
     *    to any corner.
     *
     *     d = Math.sqrt (dx * dx + dy * dy) / Math.sqrt (cx * cx + cy * cy)
     *
     * 3. Compute the multiplicative factor f from the distance. This factor
     *    should be 1.0 at the center of the picture (i.e. d=0) and then
     *    decrease to 0.0 near the edges.
     *
     *     f = 1.0 - (d * d)
     *
     * 4. Multiply each component of the pixel by the factor f. Use Math.round
     *    to convert the result to an integer value before casting to an int.
     *
     * 5. There is one special case. If the distance from the center to any
     *    corner is zero (i.e. if the picture contains a single pixel) this method
     *    should just return the original input.
